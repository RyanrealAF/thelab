    "summary": "This paper presents a systematic methodology for detecting covert orchestration in legal and political processes by analyzing multiple converging streams of evidence called \"trails.\" The approach examines communications, procedural decisions, media narratives, and institutional pressures to reveal patterns of hidden influence. It offers investigators a structured method for transforming fragmented information into coherent evidence while maintaining ethical standards."
